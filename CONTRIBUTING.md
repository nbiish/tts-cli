By contributing to this project, you are agreeing to a framework that respects and upholds the inherent sovereignty and intellectual property rights of the Rights Holder and their designated community.

## Agreement

1. **Full Assent to the Project LICENSE**: You have read, fully understand, and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of the project's primary **LICENSE** file. You understand that your contribution will be integrated into the "Work" (as defined in the LICENSE) and will be governed by its comprehensive terms.

2. **Original Work**: You represent and warrant that your contribution is your original creation and that you have the full legal right and authority to grant the rights set forth in this agreement. If your contribution includes the work of others, you represent and warrant that it is done in full compliance with their original license terms and that you have the authority to sublicense it under the terms of the project's LICENSE.

3. **Grant of Conditional Rights**: You grant to the Rights Holder, as defined in the LICENSE, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free license (revocable upon breach of this agreement or the project LICENSE) to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your contribution and such derivative works as part of the Work, subject to and governed exclusively by the project's LICENSE terms and conditions. Rights granted exclude the right to sublicense except as explicitly permitted under the project LICENSE and only to parties who have executed binding agreements to comply with all LICENSE terms and conditions. This grant automatically terminates upon any violation of the LICENSE or this agreement.

4. **Waiver of Conflicting Claims**: You waive any and all claims that your contribution, or its inclusion in the Work, is governed by any other license or legal framework. You agree that the project's LICENSE supersedes any and all other licenses that might otherwise apply to your contribution.

5. **Upholding Indigenous Sovereignty**: You acknowledge the unique legal and cultural framework of this project. You agree that your contribution is made with respect for the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty, the protection of TK and TCEs, and the jurisdictional authority of the tribal forums designated in the LICENSE.

6. **Technology Use Restrictions**: You acknowledge and agree that your contribution is subject to all technology use restrictions, data sovereignty protections, and emerging technology prohibitions as detailed in the LICENSE. You specifically warrant that you will not use, permit others to use, or facilitate the use of any contribution for any technologies or applications prohibited under the LICENSE without explicit prior informed consent as defined in the LICENSE.

7. **Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution**: You expressly consent to the jurisdiction and dispute resolution mechanisms specified in the LICENSE for all disputes arising from or related to this agreement and your contributions. You agree to be bound by the legal frameworks and jurisdictional provisions established in the LICENSE.

8. **Benefit-Sharing Acknowledgment**: You acknowledge that any commercial exploitation of the Work incorporating your contributions triggers the benefit-sharing obligations specified in the LICENSE and that you have no claim to these payments, which are directed to community development as specified in the LICENSE.

9. **Cultural Attribution Protocols**: You agree that any use, reference, or derivative work incorporating your contribution must maintain all Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, cultural attribution requirements, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty protocols specified in the LICENSE, regardless of how your contribution is integrated into the Work.

10. **Patent Non-Assertion**: If you hold or obtain patents that could be infringed by the use of your contribution, you grant the Rights Holder and all LICENSE-compliant users a perpetual, royalty-free patent license to use, make, and distribute your contribution, provided such users remain in compliance with all LICENSE terms.

11. **Third-Party Material Disclosure**: You represent that if your contribution incorporates any third-party materials, open-source components, or derivative works, you have provided complete disclosure of all such materials, their licenses, and any attribution requirements, and you warrant that such inclusion is compatible with and subordinate to the project LICENSE.

12. **Enforcement and Remedies**: You acknowledge that violations of this agreement cause irreparable harm difficult to quantify. You agree to the enforcement mechanisms, remedies, and damages specified in the LICENSE, plus attorney's fees and costs, without limiting other available remedies including injunctive relief.

13. **Equitable Relief**: You consent to immediate injunctive relief and emergency measures to prevent ongoing violations, including but not limited to takedown orders, asset freezing, and cessation of unauthorized activities.

Your contribution is a voluntary and informed act of participation in a project governed by Indigenous law and custom. Thank you for your understanding and respect.
