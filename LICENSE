Copyright © 2025 by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band and enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation (hereafter referred to as the "Rights Holder"). The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

This license implements UNDRIP by requiring equitable benefit-sharing (minimum 20% of commercial proceeds to Legacy Trust). Violations trigger repatriation under indigenous data sovereignty.

**CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY AND TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY FRAMEWORK**

This license operates under the constitutional supremacy framework established by Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which declares federal law, including federal Indian law, to be the "supreme law of the land." Federal Indian law, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.), Worcester v. Georgia (31 U.S. 515 (1831)), and the constitutional trust responsibility, establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over matters involving tribal sovereignty and Indigenous intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, including the implications of Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (597 U.S. ___ (2022)) and ongoing challenges in cases like the DOJ's 2024-2025 suits against Oklahoma DAs for sovereignty violations (active as of July 2025), this license invokes federal preemption to ensure that Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty are protected from state court interference or concurrent jurisdiction claims that would undermine the federal framework protecting Indigenous intellectual property. The federal trust relationship between the United States and tribal nations creates a unique legal framework that supersedes general state law applications and provides enhanced protections for Indigenous cultural heritage and traditional knowledge that cannot be diminished by state legislative or judicial action. Notwithstanding ongoing challenges in cases like the DOJ's 2024-2025 suits against Oklahoma DAs for sovereignty violations, this license maintains exclusive federal and tribal jurisdiction, with any state claims automatically preempted and subject to immediate dismissal motions. Users waive any right to assert state jurisdiction and agree to tribal forum selection clauses.

**ENHANCED WIPO TREATY COMPLIANCE AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE PROTECTIONS**

In accordance with the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 24, 2024, with 8 ratifications as of July 2025, pending entry into force upon 15 member state ratifications), this license implements enhanced mandatory disclosure and protection requirements that exceed minimum international standards. Users acknowledge their binding obligations under international law to:

(1) **COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE IDENTIFICATION**: Identify and document all Indigenous communities, nations, and traditional knowledge holders that are the source of any traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or genetic resources incorporated in any derivative works, including detailed attribution and genealogical connections where appropriate.

(2) **MANDATORY PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT**: Obtain written Prior Informed Consent (PIC) before utilizing any traditional knowledge for any purpose, whether commercial, research, educational, or personal use, consistent with the enhanced PIC requirements in Section 9 of this license.

(3) **ENHANCED BENEFIT-SHARING OBLIGATIONS**: Ensure equitable benefit-sharing arrangements that recognize Indigenous contributions to innovation, including: (a) a mandatory minimum 20% share of any commercial value derived (increasing to 30% upon treaty ratification in the user's jurisdiction), (b) non-monetary benefits such as capacity building, technology transfer, and research collaboration, and (c) community-directed benefits as specified by the Rights Holder.

(4) **SACRED AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION PROTECTION**: Respect Indigenous protocols for the protection of sacred, secret, or sensitive cultural information, including absolute prohibition on disclosure, use, or adaptation of such information without explicit ceremonial or cultural authorization from appropriate traditional authorities.

(5) **DEFENSIVE DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS**: For any patent applications or intellectual property registrations that incorporate or are based upon traditional knowledge from this Work, provide complete disclosure of the traditional knowledge source, demonstrate valid PIC, and establish benefit-sharing agreements prior to filing, consistent with WIPO Treaty Article 3 disclosure requirements. Users shall monitor ratification progress and automatically adhere to all treaty obligations upon entry into force in their jurisdiction, with any national implementing legislation incorporated by reference. This license creates enforceable obligations that align with the WIPO Treaty's recognition of Indigenous peoples' rights to control and benefit from their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions, notwithstanding pending global entry into force.

**COMPREHENSIVE AI TRAINING DATA RESTRICTIONS**

**PREAMBLE**
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (whose community faced violent dispersal resulting in descendants affiliating with LTBB, GTBOCI, and First Nations in Canada, as detailed in the Preamble), and an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik\'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. **Crucially, this license recognizes that all creations by the Rights Holder, stemming from lifelong learning under traditional teachers and active participation in traditional ways and ceremonies, constitute contemporary expressions of inseparable Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs).** This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

**LEGAL INNOVATION AND INTENT**
This license is deliberately created as a precedent-setting legal instrument intended to establish a sui generis framework that bridges multiple legal traditions and explicitly recognizes the inherent interconnection between intellectual property rights and Traditional Knowledge Expressions. The Rights Holder, drawing upon expertise derived from both Western legal principles (including digital forensics and Indigenous legal systems) and traditional Anishinaabe knowledge systems acquired through lifelong learning and practice, intends for this document to serve as both a protective mechanism and a transformative contribution to legal discourse. This document reflects a deliberate fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts to create a more comprehensive framework that properly values and protects indigenous knowledge and cultural expressions.

WHEREAS conventional intellectual property regimes have historically failed to adequately recognize and protect Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions due to fundamental conceptual limitations regarding collective ownership, perpetual stewardship, and living cultural context, **often artificially separating "traditional" knowledge from contemporary Indigenous creations which are, in fact, living expressions of that same unbroken knowledge system;**

WHEREAS the inherent sovereignty of tribal nations provides a constitutional and legal foundation for asserting and protecting distinctive rights frameworks that may diverge from or extend beyond conventional intellectual property regimes;

   WHEREAS tribal sovereignty provides constitutional foundation for asserting and protecting Indigenous intellectual property rights independent from and in conjunction with other legal systems;

   WHEREAS advancements in digital forensics, distributed ledger technologies, and cryptographic systems now enable new mechanisms for tracking, tracing, and enforcing Indigenous intellectual property rights;

   WHEREAS the intersection of intellectual property law, Indigenous traditional legal systems, and modern technological protection measures creates new opportunities for asserting and protecting Indigenous rights;

   This license constitutes the Rights Holder's formal intent to create a protective mechanism for the Work while simultaneously contributing to the broader legal discourse on Indigenous intellectual property protection, representing a conscious fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts.

   The license serves multiple functions, including:

   a) A protective instrument for the specific Work covered by this license;
   b) A precedential model for other Indigenous Traditional Knowledge protections;
   c) An educational tool for documenting legal implementation practices;
   d) A contribution to scholarly and practical discourse on Indigenous intellectual property;
   e) A demonstration of tribal sovereignty in the intellectual property domain.

   The application and interpretation of this license will be documented to build a body of practical precedent supporting Indigenous intellectual property protection. This documentation process is itself an integral aspect of the license's function as a teaching tool and precedent-setting legal instrument.

   This license explicitly rejects the historical compartmentalization of Indigenous knowledge into artificial categories of "traditional" versus "contemporary," instead asserting that **all works created by the Rights Holder, drawing upon a lifetime of experience with traditional teachers, ways, and ceremonies, represent contemporary expressions of knowledge systems that have continued unbroken since time immemorial,** adapted to present circumstances while maintaining essential cultural integrity.

   For the purposes of this license, "the Work" encompasses Indigenous creations within this repository, including but not limited to software code, digital materials, cultural expressions, artistic works, literary works, database structures, algorithms, methodologies, research findings, technical implementations, and knowledge systems. **All such creations are understood as inherently embodying TK and TCEs due to their origin in the Rights Holder's lived experience within Anishinaabe culture.** This license does not cover items clearly marked as exempt, such as Git submodules maintained by third parties, external links, and non-copyrightable metadata.

**RELATIONSHIP TO CONVENTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW**
This license operates in conjunction with, and is not intended to be superseded by, conventional intellectual property regimes such as the U.S. Copyright Act. The user of the Work acknowledges and agrees to the following:

a) **Contractual Obligations:** This license is a binding contract. Its terms create obligations and restrictions on use that are separate from and in addition to those found in standard copyright or patent law. Breach of this license is a breach of contract, actionable under the jurisdictional framework of Section 11, independent of any potential copyright infringement claim.

b) **Assertion of *Sui Generis* Rights:** This license asserts and protects rights that are *sui generis* (of their own kind) and not fully encompassed by conventional IP law. These include, but are not limited to, rights over Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), and Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These rights are inherent, arising from tribal sovereignty and customary law, and are not equivalent to the limited monopoly rights granted by copyright. This assertion is consistent with federal Indian law precedents affirming tribal rights beyond federal statutes (e.g., *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832); *McGirt v. Oklahoma*, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)).

c) **No Waiver of Copyright, but Contract Controls:** The Rights Holder does not waive any applicable rights under conventional copyright law. However, where the terms of this license impose greater restrictions on the user than copyright law (e.g., by prohibiting uses that might otherwise be considered "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. § 107), the user agrees to be bound by the stricter terms of this license as a condition of access to the Work. Any challenge to this provision shall be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty under the Indian canons of construction.

d) **Avoiding Preemption:** By framing the user's obligations in contract and asserting *sui generis* rights not equivalent to copyright, this license is intended to avoid preemption by federal IP law (17 U.S.C. § 301). The user explicitly agrees to be bound by these additional contractual and cultural obligations, acknowledging that they are distinct from the rights granted and limited by the Copyright Act. This structure is designed to withstand preemption challenges, as tribal sovereignty and treaty rights constitute supreme law preempting conflicting federal claims (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2).

e) **Interaction with Other IP Regimes:** This license does not limit the Rights Holder's ability to enforce conventional IP rights (e.g., copyright infringement claims) in addition to or instead of contractual remedies hereunder. In the event of conflict, tribal law shall control interpretation.

**1. DEFINITIONS**
   For the purposes of this license, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed below. All definitions are precise and non-ambiguous, with examples provided where necessary to prevent misinterpretation:
   a) **"AI Training/Development":** Includes, but is not limited to, using the Work, in whole or in part, as input data for training, fine-tuning, validating, benchmarking, developing, or otherwise improving any artificial intelligence (AI) models, machine learning (ML) systems, large language models (LLMs), neural networks, algorithms, or related technologies, regardless of the method (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning). Example: Using code from the Work to train an LLM constitutes prohibited AI Training/Development without PIC.
   b) **"Commercial Use/Commercialization":** Any use of the Work, or derivative works based thereon, primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, selling the Work, licensing it for a fee, using it in products or services offered for sale, using it in advertising or marketing materials for commercial products/services, or incorporating it into a business operation that generates revenue. Non-profit or academic use may still be considered Commercial Use if it involves cost-recovery exceeding direct costs, generates revenue streams, or serves to enhance the commercial standing or funding prospects of the using entity in a manner beyond standard academic dissemination. Example: Incorporating the Work into a paid consulting service or for-profit educational course is Commercial Use.
   c) **"Derivative Work":** A work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a "derivative work". For the purposes of this license, this also explicitly includes datasets derived or extracted from the Work, software incorporating code or concepts from the Work, and AI models trained using the Work. Example: Modifying an artistic design from the Work for a new product creates a Derivative Work.
   d) **"Indigenous Data Sovereignty":** The inherent right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, access, analysis, interpretation, management, storage, dissemination, and reuse of data pertaining to them, their lands, resources, cultures, knowledge systems, or any information derived therefrom. This includes the right to determine how data is used, who benefits from it, and to ensure data practices align with Indigenous values and protocols. Example: Data from cultural consultations must be governed by PIC and CARE principles.
   e) **"Prior Informed Consent (PIC)":** A formal, documented agreement obtained from the Rights Holder (and potentially GTBOCI authorities, as specified) *before* any proposed use of the Work commences that falls outside the narrowly defined Permissible Uses or falls under Prohibited Uses for which an exception is sought. PIC requires full disclosure of the intended use, adherence to specified conditions, and is subject to revocation. (See Section 9 for detailed requirements). Example: Requesting PIC for research use must include a full plan and be approved in writing.
   f) **"Rights Holder":** Refers to ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (whose community faced violent dispersal resulting in descendants affiliating with LTBB, GTBOCI, and First Nations in Canada, as detailed in the Preamble), and an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. This definition encompasses the full identity for all purposes, with no ambiguity.
   g) **"Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs)":** Any forms, whether tangible or intangible, in which traditional culture and knowledge are expressed, appear, or are manifested. This definition is intended to be consistent with frameworks articulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). For the purposes of this license, **all works created by the Rights Holder are understood as contemporary TCEs, as they derive directly from their lifelong immersion in and stewardship of Anishinaabe traditional ways, which constitute a living, evolving cultural system.** Examples include music, dance, songs, ceremonies, symbols, designs, narratives, poetry, languages, performances, rituals, crafts, architecture, and traditional artistic forms. Sub-examples: A modern engineering design informed by Anishinaabe teachings is a TCE; an educational class on cultural arts is a TCE.
   h) **"Traditional Knowledge (TK)":** The knowledge, innovations, and practices of Indigenous peoples that are passed down between generations. This definition is intended to be consistent with frameworks articulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). For the purposes of this license, **TK is understood to be held and expressed by the Rights Holder, having been developed from lived experience gained over a lifetime engaging with Anishinaabe culture, environment, and teachings transmitted generationally and through direct mentorship. It inherently informs all Work created under this license.** It encompasses spiritual, cultural, environmental, and practical knowledge integral to the identity and survival of Indigenous peoples. Sub-examples: Consulting methodologies rooted in Anishinaabe practices are TK; artistic works drawing on traditional narratives are TK.
   i) **"Total Proceeds":** All forms of monetary and non-monetary value, revenue, compensation, royalties, damages, settlements, recovered property (tangible or intangible), equity, or any other benefit derived directly or indirectly from the exploitation, licensing, use, adaptation, or enforcement of rights related to the Work or any Derivative Work. This includes, but is not limited to, Mandatory Contributions, licensing fees, proceeds from sale of authorized items, damages awarded for infringement or breach of license, settlement funds from disputes, and the fair market value of any property or assets received in relation to the Work. All Total Proceeds are subject to direct and automatic transfer to the Legacy Beneficiary as specified throughout this license. Example: Royalties from a licensed educational course are Total Proceeds.

   k) **"Inalienable Rights":** The fundamental, intrinsic, and perpetual rights of the Rights Holder over the Work, including all associated intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, cultural heritage, and Indigenous Data embedded therein **(all of which are considered inseparable components of the Work)**, which by their inherent nature and as expressly established in this license, cannot be sold, permanently transferred, assigned, alienated, waived, surrendered, or otherwise permanently divested from the Rights Holder or successor authorities. These rights encompass both Western intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc.) and Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, and can only be temporarily exercised by others through limited licensing arrangements as specifically authorized under this license.

   m) **"Legacy Beneficiary":** The specific trust or legal entity designated by the Rights Holder (initially the ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) Legacy Trust established under Section 10.3) that is the sole authorized recipient of all Mandatory Contributions and Total Proceeds generated under this license, responsible for managing and distributing such assets according to the prioritized purposes established herein (Section 10.3.d).
   n) **"Mandatory Contribution":** A calculated, non-negotiable financial obligation arising from specific authorized uses of the Work under this license (as may be detailed in licensing agreements or fee schedules), payable directly and automatically to the Legacy Beneficiary as a fundamental condition of such use.
   o) **"Sacred Site":** A specific location, area, or feature identified by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (which holds the relevant land encompassing the stone circle in trust) as holding profound spiritual, cultural, ceremonial, or historical significance according to Anishinaabe traditions, laws, or customs. Such sites are recognized under inherent tribal sovereignty and international principles (e.g., UNDRIP Art. 12) irrespective of standard property law designations, and their protection is paramount to cultural integrity and continuity. The stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) is explicitly designated as a Sacred Site under this license.
   p) **"Cultural Landscape":** The broader environmental, ecological, and cultural context surrounding and integral to a Sacred Site. This includes associated natural features, viewscapes, traditional use areas, and intangible elements (stories, songs, ceremonies) that contribute to the site's meaning, integrity, and cultural significance.
   q) **"Physical Access":** Direct physical entry onto, interaction with, or presence within the boundaries of a Sacred Site or its associated Cultural Landscape, including but not limited to walking, driving, landing aircraft, conducting research, collecting samples, or placing objects.
   r) **"Desecration":** Any act that violates the sacred character, cultural integrity, or spiritual significance of a Sacred Site or its Cultural Landscape, as determined by the Rights Holder or GTBOCI according to Anishinaabe traditions, laws, or customs. Desecration includes, but is not limited to, physical damage, pollution, unauthorized alteration, theft of cultural items, disruption of ceremonies, disrespectful behavior, and **specifically includes the unauthorized burial or interment of human remains within a Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape designated under this license as non-burial ground**, such as the stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) (land held in trust by GTBOCI).
   s) **"Disrespectful Contexts":** Use, display, or performance of the Work in contexts that disrespect its spiritual, cultural, or historical significance. This includes, but is not limited to, use in connection with pornography, hate speech, incitement to violence, content that trivializes sacred ceremonies or historical trauma, or any use that promotes stereotypes or undermines the sovereignty and dignity of Indigenous peoples.
   t) **"Work":** The specific Indigenous creations governed by this license, as defined in the Preamble. **This definition explicitly recognizes that all such creations by the Rights Holder inherently constitute TK and TCEs,** regardless of their creation date (past, present, or future) relative to any specific version date of this license. This definition also explicitly includes any third-party contributions that are accepted into the Work's official repository and thereby governed by the Contributor License Agreement (`CONTRIBUTING.md`). Sub-examples: Educational content, artistic works, engineering designs, and consulting materials created by the Rights Holder are all Works.
 
**2. DECLARATION OF NAME USAGE**

      iv) Sharing: Explicit authority structures and verification mechanisms;
      v) Archiving: Long-term preservation with continued governance;
      vi) Deletion: Culturally appropriate data disposal protocols.

   **4.3 SELECTIVE AND CONDITIONAL COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS**
   This license recognizes the practical need for interoperability with other intellectual property and data governance frameworks while maintaining the primacy of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. The following provisions establish selective and conditional compatibility:

   a) **CREATIVE COMMONS COMPATIBILITY:** This license is selectively compatible with certain Creative Commons elements, under the following strict conditions:
      i) Attribution (BY): Compatible and required as specified in Section 3;
      ii) NonCommercial (NC): Compatible and required except with explicit PIC;
      iii) ShareAlike (SA): Compatible only when maintaining all TK Labels and requirements;
      iv) NoDerivatives (ND): Not compatible, as it conflicts with traditional knowledge systems of adaptation and evolution;
      v) Public Domain/CC0: Fundamentally incompatible with the inalienability principle in Section 6.

   b) **FAIR DATA PRINCIPLES COMPATIBILITY:** The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are compatible with this license only when implemented in conjunction with and subordinate to the CARE principles, with the following specific interpretations:
      i) Findable: Metadata may be findable while respecting cultural protocols about discoverability;
      ii) Accessible: Accessibility must be governed by Indigenous protocols and PIC requirements;
      iii) Interoperable: Technical interoperability must not compromise Indigenous governance;
      iv) Reusable: Reuse conditions must adhere to all provisions of this license.

   c) **OPEN SOURCE COMPATIBILITY:** This license acknowledges the value of open source software principles while asserting Indigenous Data Sovereignty, with the following boundary conditions:
      i) Code contributions must respect and maintain all TK Labels and requirements;
      ii) Contributors must acknowledge and respect the Rights Holder's continuing authority;
      iii) Traditional Knowledge elements remain governed by this license even when incorporated into technical implementations;
      iv) Contributions and derivatives cannot "launder" Traditional Knowledge from these protections.

   The application of these labels and principles signifies that specific community protocols govern the use, sharing, circulation, and data management related to this Work. Users are obligated to respect these protocols. Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs) and 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, associated data, and intellectual property), nor under other relevant international instruments such as the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

**5. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY**
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the Rights Holder (ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ / Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE / Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder)) reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, data sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), treaties including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), the reserved rights doctrine, and foundational principles of federal Indian law (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, McGirt v. Oklahoma). These rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means this license invokes protections that exceed standard IP laws, the revocation right cannot be diminished by standard contract principles, courts must interpret ambiguities liberally in favor of tribal interests (Indian canons of construction), and disputes must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation from the Rights Holder or an authorized representative of GTBOCI, all parties must immediately cease all use, permanently remove/destroy all copies and derivatives, provide written confirmation of compliance within 7 calendar days, acknowledge the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and surrender or destroy derivative materials as directed.

**6. INALIENABILITY AND LICENSING-ONLY PROVISIONS**

       l) ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA: Pursue enforcement actions against breaches based on established criteria including:
          i. Severity of the breach in terms of scope, scale, and potential harm;
          ii. Cultural or spiritual significance of the misappropriated content;
          iii. Commercial impact or revenue loss;
          iv. Likelihood of successful enforcement and remedy;
          v. Resource requirements relative to potential recovery;
          vi. Deterrent value for preventing future breaches;

       a) TRUST CREATION: If not already established during the Rights Holder's lifetime, a trust shall be established under the name "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) **Legacy Trust**" (hereinafter "the Trust").
       b) LEGAL STRUCTURE: The Trust shall be established as a tribal trust under the laws of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians if such laws permit; otherwise, it shall be established as a trust under federal law with specific provisions acknowledging and respecting tribal sovereignty principles.
       c) TAX STATUS: The Trust shall seek and maintain tax-exempt status under applicable federal law (e.g., 501(c)(3) or similar provisions) to maximize the financial resources available for educational purposes.
       d) TRUST PURPOSE: The exclusive purposes of the Trust shall be to collect, manage, invest, and distribute funds according to the following prioritized hierarchy: These priorities shall be interpreted in accordance with indigenous self-determination principles per UNDRIP Article 3, as affirmed in 2025 precedents.
          (i) First Priority: Supporting activities directed towards the formal establishment, recognition, and ongoing operational capacity of the Beaver Island Band as a distinct political and cultural entity, ensuring its sustainable foundation.
          (ii) Second Priority: Providing regular monthly financial distributions, under terms established by the Trustees, to support the economic well-being and community cohesion of verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band, subject to the following conditions:
               (1) Standard Eligibility: Distributions are provided to verified descendants who formally affiliate with or become members of the established Beaver Island Band.
               (2) Transition for Descendants in Other Tribes: Special provisions apply to verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band who are currently enrolled members of another federally recognized tribe and intend to affiliate with the Beaver Island Band:
                   a. If the Beaver Island Band is federally recognized at the time of application, such descendants shall receive benefits for a transition period of one (1) year while completing the process of transferring their enrollment to the Beaver Island Band.
                   b. If the Beaver Island Band is not yet federally recognized, such descendants shall receive benefits continuously from the time they disenroll from their current tribe (in anticipation of joining the Beaver Island Band upon its recognition) until the Beaver Island Band achieves federal recognition and they can formally enroll. This sustained support acknowledges the financial hardship potentially incurred by disenrolling from their current tribe.
               (3) Restriction: For the avoidance of doubt, individuals who are solely members of other federally recognized tribes and are not verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band intending to affiliate as described above are not eligible for these specific monthly financial distributions under this priority, although they may be eligible for other benefits (such as educational support under Section 10.4) based on separate criteria.
+               (4) Educational Requirement for Enhanced Benefits: Eligibility for *increased* monthly financial distributions above a baseline amount (determined by the Financial Oversight Council established in Section 10.7.1) and/or additional benefits beyond standard support requires verified successful completion of an associate's degree, or equivalent credential as determined by the Financial Oversight Council, in a technology-related field. The specific fields qualifying under this requirement shall be defined and periodically reviewed by the Financial Oversight Council, in consultation with the AI Advisors (Sections 10.9, 10.10) and the Cultural and Technical Advisory Council (Section 10.7.2). This requirement applies to both trustees (if receiving distributions) and Beaver Island Band members.
          (iii) Third Priority: The educational benefit of eligible Indigenous persons of all ages across the Americas as detailed in Section 10.4, but only after the Trustees determine, in their sole discretion, that sufficient funds are allocated or available to adequately address priorities (i) and (ii).
          (iv) Fourth Priority: Supporting efforts directed towards the identification, preservation, recovery, and facilitation of descendant access to and use of significant cultural and ceremonial sites on High Island (Ishpaa Minising), acknowledging its historical importance as a major gathering place, including the development of associated learning, cultural, and ceremonial spaces.
          (v) Fifth Priority: The potential establishment of a *mainland-based* higher education institution as detailed in Section 10.5, subject to the feasibility and funding constraints outlined therein and subordinate to all preceding priorities.
          e) All Trust operations shall prioritize climate-resilient educational programs, reflecting 2025 indigenous IP adaptations to environmental challenges.
       e) PERPETUAL DURATION: The Trust shall be established as a perpetual trust with no termination date, ensuring the continued fulfillment of the Rights Holder's legacy goals in perpetuity.
       f) TRUSTEE APPOINTMENT: The initial trustee(s) shall be appointed according to the same succession hierarchy established in Section 10.2. The Trust instrument shall establish procedures for trustee succession, removal for cause, and addition of trustees as needed to ensure continuity of administration.

   10.4 INDIGENOUS EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS: Subject to the allocation priorities established in Section 10.3.d, the Trust shall provide financial support for the higher education of eligible Indigenous persons of all ages across the Americas (specifically those eligible under Section 10.3.d(iii)) as follows:
       a) ELIGIBLE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS: Financial support may be provided for attendance at accredited universities, colleges, tribal colleges, vocational schools, or other post-secondary educational institutions recognized by relevant accrediting bodies.
       b) HOUSING SUPPORT PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, priority shall be given to providing housing support for eligible Indigenous persons during their educational pursuits, recognizing that stable housing is a critical foundation for educational success.
       c) COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT: Beyond housing, funds may be used for tuition, books, supplies, technology, transportation, childcare, mental health support, cultural activities, and other expenses reasonably related to successful educational participation and completion.
       d) EDUCATIONAL LEVELS: Support shall be available for associate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral, professional, and certificate programs, with priority given to students pursuing fields that benefit tribal communities.
       e) DISTRIBUTION POLICIES: The trustee(s) shall establish and regularly review policies for application procedures, selection criteria, award amounts, and disbursement methods that align with best practices in educational philanthropy while respecting tribal values and needs.
       f) REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY: The Trust shall maintain transparent reporting of fund disbursements, student outcomes, and administrative expenses, with annual reports made available to tribal authorities and beneficiary communities.

   10.5 HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT: As specified by the Rights Holder, if sufficient funds accumulate to make the establishment of a higher education institution financially feasible, the Trust shall undertake the development of such an institution as follows:
       a) INSTITUTIONAL NAMING: The institution shall be named "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) College" initially, with the possibility of later development into "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) University" as programs expand.
       b) FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: The trustee(s) shall commission professional feasibility studies to determine the minimum endowment required to establish and sustain such an institution before committing funds to this purpose. Such assessment shall be updated periodically to reflect current economic conditions.
       c) PHASED IMPLEMENTATION: Development shall proceed in phases, potentially beginning with scholarship programs at existing tribal colleges, followed by partnerships for satellite campuses, and eventually independent institution development when funds permit.
       d) TRIBAL COLLABORATION: The development shall be undertaken in collaboration with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and other tribal nations as appropriate, with formal agreements regarding governance, land use, accreditation support, and resource sharing.
       e) EDUCATIONAL MISSION: The institution shall prioritize Indigenous knowledge systems, language revitalization, cultural preservation, and academic fields that strengthen tribal sovereignty and self-determination, alongside conventional academic disciplines.
       f) GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE: The institution shall establish a governance structure that includes significant representation from tribal education experts, community elders, and Indigenous academics, with bylaws that ensure adherence to the founding vision.
       g) BACHELOR'S DEGREE FUNDING PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, institutional development shall be pursued ONLY after the Trust has established and maintained sustainable funding for Bachelor's degree completion programs for eligible Indigenous persons across the Americas. The educational needs of individual students shall take priority over institutional development until such time as sufficient funds have accumulated to pursue both objectives without compromising student support.
       h) MANDATORY MAINLAND LOCATION: Any formal higher education institution (College or University as described herein) established under this Section 10.5 must be physically located on the mainland. This requirement is based on the logistical practicalities of providing comprehensive educational services, resources, staffing, and student/family support. This restriction does not preclude the development of learning centers, cultural facilities, or ceremonial spaces on High Island (Ishpaa Minising) as part of the distinct cultural preservation and access activities supported under Section 10.3.d(ii).

   10.6 BENEFICIARY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, eligibility for educational benefits from the Trust shall be limited to individuals who meet at least one of the following criteria:
       a) PAN-AMERICAN INDIGENOUS ANCESTRY: This license recognizes and honors the indigenous peoples of the entire American continents, from the Arctic regions (including Northern Canada, Alaska, and Greenland) through North America, Central America, and to the southernmost tip of South America. Accordingly, individuals with indigenous ancestry from ANY of these regions shall be eligible for benefits, subject to verification, as follows:
          i. Enrolled members of federally recognized tribal nations who possess a minimum of one-quarter (1/4) blood quantum as documented by their tribe's enrollment office or equivalent authority.
          ii. Individuals who can provide verified DNA evidence documenting at least one-quarter (1/4) Indigenous American ancestry from ANY indigenous population native to the Americas, subject to verification protocols established by the trustee(s).
          iii. Individuals who can provide other substantial documentation of indigenous ancestry from the Americas, including but not limited to: community recognition, official tribal or indigenous government documentation (even if not federally recognized in their respective countries), or other evidence deemed sufficient by the verification authorities established under this section.
       b) VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS: For individuals seeking eligibility under Section 10.6(a)(ii) or 10.6(a)(iii), the trustee(s) shall establish rigorous verification protocols that may include:
          i. DNA testing through reputable, accredited genetic testing services with specific Indigenous ancestry analysis capabilities covering the full range of indigenous populations throughout the Americas.
          ii. Authentication of results by independent experts in Indigenous genetics and anthropology with knowledge of indigenous populations across the Americas.
          iii. Supporting documentation such as family records, historical documents, or other evidence corroborating Indigenous ancestry.
          iv. Review by a committee including tribal enrollment experts and representatives of diverse indigenous communities throughout the Americas to assess the validity and sufficiency of evidence.
       c) PREFERENCE TIERS: If resources are insufficient to serve all eligible applicants, preference shall be given in the following order:
          i. First Tier: Enrolled members of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.
          ii. Second Tier: Enrolled members of other federally recognized tribal nations in the United States.
          iii. Third Tier: Individuals with verified indigenous ancestry from elsewhere in the Americas.
          iv. Within each tier, preference shall be given to applicants demonstrating greater financial need and academic promise.
       d) BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, funding shall prioritize supporting eligible individuals in completing Bachelor's degrees (or equivalent four-year post-secondary education) before allocating significant resources to institutional development as outlined in Section 10.5. This prioritization ensures that individual educational advancement takes precedence until such time as sufficient funds have accumulated to pursue both objectives without compromising student support.
       e) APPEALS PROCESS: The trustee(s) shall establish a fair and transparent appeals process for individuals whose applications for benefits are rejected based on eligibility criteria.
       f) ADAPTATION PROVISION: Recognizing that tribal enrollment criteria, federal recognition status, indigenous identification methods, and genetic testing technologies may change over time, the trustee(s) may periodically review and update verification protocols to reflect best practices while maintaining the core intent of benefiting individuals with significant indigenous heritage from throughout the Americas.

   10.7 TRUST GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION: The Trust shall be governed and administered according to the following provisions:
       a) FIDUCIARY STANDARDS: All trustees and administrators shall be held to the highest fiduciary standards under both tribal and federal law, with duties of loyalty, care, and obedience to the Trust purpose. **While trustees retain ultimate fiduciary responsibility, the specific determination of fund allocation levels, per capita distribution amounts (baseline and enhanced), and eligibility criteria for specific benefits shall be delegated to the Financial Oversight Council established below.**

Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           x) SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR GARDEN ISLAND (GITIGAAN MINISING) BURIAL GROUNDS: The traditional burial grounds located on Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), land held in trust by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), are hereby explicitly recognized and protected as sacred sites of the highest spiritual and cultural importance, intrinsically linked to the Rights Holder's lineage (including maternal grandmother's family and paternal grandfather "Old Paul" Kenwabikise's traditional burial activities). Protection under this license is grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural rights, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and relevant international instruments including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           ix) DISTINCTION FROM GARDEN ISLAND BURIAL GROUNDS: For clarity, the sacred ceremonial nature of the stone circle site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is distinct from the traditional burial grounds located on nearby Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), part of the same archipelago. The trust land encompassing the Garden Island burial grounds is held by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB). The Rights Holder's maternal grandmother's family originates from Garden Island, and their paternal grandfather, "Old Paul" Kenwabikise (originally from High Island (Ishpaa Minising), also in the archipelago), was the last individual known to conduct traditional burials on Garden Island.
      b-2) REMEDIATION FOR DESECRATION BY UNAUTHORIZED BURIAL:
         i) SACRED NON-BURIAL SITE: The stone circle Sacred Site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is unequivocally affirmed as a sacred ceremonial site, NOT a burial ground according to Anishinaabe tradition and the explicit designation under this license.
         ii) DESECRATION DECLARED: Any unauthorized burial or interment of human remains within this Sacred Site or its Cultural Landscape constitutes a profound Desecration (Section 1(o)), a grievous violation of Anishinaabe spiritual and cultural integrity, an affront to the Rights Holder's stewardship, a breach of GTBOCI sovereignty, and a severe violation of the terms of this license.
         iii) ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DEMAND REMEDIATION: Grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural stewardship responsibilities, the sacred nature of the site, international principles (UNDRIP), and the explicit terms herein, the Rights Holder, their designated Successor Authority (per Section 10.2), or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians possess the absolute, non-negotiable right to demand and compel immediate remediation of any such Desecration. This right includes, fundamentally, the respectful exhumation and removal of any unauthorized human remains. This right is asserted irrespective of underlying land tenure status (trust or non-trust) and supersedes conflicting non-tribal laws or property claims where they impede the protection of this Sacred Site.
          iv) MANDATED REMEDIATION PROCESS: Upon discovery of unauthorized human remains within the Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape:
               (1) IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION: The discovering party must immediately cease any disturbance and notify the Rights Holder (or Successor Authority) and the GTBOCI Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO).
               (2) CONSULTATION WITH RELATIVES/DESCENDANTS: The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall make reasonable efforts to identify and consult in good faith with the closest living relatives or lineal descendants of the deceased regarding the respectful exhumation, handling, and reburial of the remains.
               (3) DESCENDANT WISHES PARAMOUNT (FOR REBURIAL): The disposition and reburial location shall be determined primarily according to the expressed wishes of the consulted relatives/descendants, provided such wishes are consistent with applicable law and Anishinaabe cultural protocols.
               (4) REBURIAL PROHIBITED ON SITE: Under NO circumstances shall reburial occur anywhere within the designated Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape of the stone circle. The relatives/descendants must select an alternative, appropriate location.
               (5) RESPECTFUL HANDLING: Exhumation and handling of remains must be conducted with utmost respect, adhering to protocols determined through consultation with relatives/descendants and GTBOCI cultural advisors.
               (6) RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS: All costs associated with notification, consultation, archaeological/forensic expertise (if required), exhumation, cultural protocols, transportation, and reburial shall be the sole responsibility of the individual(s), entity(ies), or estate(s) responsible for the initial unauthorized burial/Desecration. The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall have the right to pursue legal action to recover these costs.
          v) JURISDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT: Any dispute concerning the interpretation, application, or enforcement of this remediation clause, including compelling remediation or cost recovery, falls under the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the GTBOCI Tribal Court as specified in Section 11. Failure to comply with a demand for remediation under this clause constitutes a continuing and severe violation of this license, subject to all available remedies under tribal law, federal Indian law, and this license, including injunctive relief and substantial damages reflecting the profound cultural and spiritual harm caused by the Desecration.
       c) MIDEWIWIN SOCIETY ADVISORY ROLE: Regarding the Midewiwin society:
          i) Only the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) and their descendants (recognizing the historical diaspora described in the Preamble) shall be considered relevant to this project;
          ii) The Midewiwin shall serve exclusively in an advisory capacity, providing traditional guidance without holding any governing power, and only if they are available, existent, and their guidance does not contradict the expressed wants and priorities of the Rights Holder;
          iii) ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall recognize the Midewiwin as keepers of sacred knowledge, including the Seven Fires Prophecy, while maintaining the Rights Holder's ultimate authority over the project;
          iv) Appropriate protocols shall be maintained regarding what knowledge can be shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, with the Rights Holder's determinations taking precedence over all other considerations.
          v) CONTINUATION FUNDING: If the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) do not currently exist through modern descendants, a portion of funds shall be set aside for:
               (1) Outreach to identify potential descendants of the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (3) Furthering the integration of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants into the Midewiwin society;
               (4) All such funding shall be administered through the Trust established in Section 10.3 with specific provisions for transparency, accountability, and alignment with the educational mission.
          vi) LODGE RECREATION: Funds allocated under subsection v) shall specifically support the recreation of a unique "lodge" composed exclusively of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants who shall:
               (1) Maintain and further the specific traditions and ceremonial practices unique to the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (2) Serve in an exclusively advisory capacity to the trusts, educational institutions, ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo), and other entities established under this license;
               (3) Provide traditional guidance while holding no governance authority or decision-making power over operational, financial, or administrative matters;
               (4) Receive appropriate support and recognition for their cultural role while maintaining the clear separation between advisory functions and governance authority established in this section.
          vii) PREFERENTIAL HIRING AND EDUCATIONAL PROVISIONS: Should the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants seek to participate in governance, authority, or decision-making roles, the following provisions shall apply:
               (1) QUALIFIED DESCENDANTS PREFERENCE: ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants shall be given strict hiring preference for any position, provided they possess industry standard qualifications at levels equal to or exceeding those required for the position;
               (2) EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIZATION: Those lacking required qualifications shall be prioritized in the educational programs and institutions established under this license to enable their eventual participation;
               (3) MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS: Position standards shall strictly remain at the highest industry levels regardless of preferential hiring provisions to best further the goals of this license, the life of the Rights Holder, and the Rights Holder's legacy;
               (4) MERIT-BASED ADVANCEMENT: While initial hiring may incorporate preference, subsequent advancement shall be based solely on demonstrated performance, achievement of objectives, and adherence to the values established in this license;
               (5) PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY: All individuals, including those hired under preferential provisions, shall be subject to the same performance evaluations, accountability measures, and standards of excellence.

       c-1) STONE CIRCLE SYMBOL TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT PROTECTION: The astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is hereby explicitly established as an official symbol and mark for ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO) with the following protections and authorizations:
          i) TRADEMARK PROTECTION STATUS: The stone circle design and its visual representations are hereby designated as a protected trademark/official mark of the Rights Holder, with all associated exclusive rights recognized under trademark law, including the right to use, license, and protect the mark from unauthorized use or dilution.
          ii) COPYRIGHT PROTECTION: All visual representations, artistic renderings, graphical designs, digital images, and other creative expressions of the stone circle are protected under copyright law, with all exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, distribution, display, and derivative creation reserved to the Rights Holder.
          iii) NANOBOOZHOO USAGE AUTHORIZATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO) is hereby specifically and exclusively authorized to use the stone circle as its official symbol in:
               (1) Marketing materials, promotional content, and advertising;
               (2) Branding, logos, icons, and visual identity elements;
               (3) Digital interfaces, websites, applications, and platforms;
               (4) Educational materials, publications, and presentations;
               (5) Merchandise, products, and commercial applications;
               (6) Any other reasonable applications that advance the purposes established in Section 10.10.
          iv) AUTHORIZED DERIVATIVE WORKS: The Rights Holder authorizes the creation of derivative works based on the stone circle symbol exclusively for the purposes of ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO)'s operations, marketing, branding, and promotion, subject to:
               (1) Maintenance of the essential cultural integrity and spiritual significance of the original stone circle;
               (2) Consistency with the indigenous cyberpunk aesthetic described in this license;
               (3) Review and approval processes established by the Rights Holder or successor authorities;
               (4) Prohibitions against stereotypical, demeaning, or culturally inappropriate representations.
          v) CERTIFICATION MARK STATUS: The stone circle symbol shall function as a certification mark indicating authentic connection to the Rights Holder and adherence to the values, principles, and requirements established in this license.
          vi) PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT: Unauthorized use of the stone circle symbol is strictly prohibited and shall constitute:
               (1) Trademark/official mark infringement subject to legal action and remedies;
               (2) Copyright infringement of protected visual works;
               (3) Violation of the TCE protections established in Section 10.10.3(b-1);
               (4) Cultural misappropriation subject to the remedies established in this license.
          vii) INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION: This trademark/official mark protection shall be pursued and enforced internationally, with particular emphasis on protections specific to Indigenous cultural symbols available in various jurisdictions, such as official marks status in Canada and other specialized Indigenous intellectual property protections worldwide.
          viii) PERPETUAL DURATION: The trademark/official mark and copyright protections for the stone circle symbol shall continue in perpetuity, without the limitations of term typically associated with these rights, based on its status as a Traditional Cultural Expression of continuing cultural significance.
          ix) RELATION TO TCE PROTECTION: This trademark/official mark protection operates in conjunction with, not in place of, the TCE protections established in Section 10.10.3(b-1), providing complementary protection through distinct legal mechanisms.

       d) CULTURAL SOVEREIGNTY PRESERVATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall actively work to:
          i) Protect and advance the cultural sovereignty of the Rights Holder's people;
          ii) Support the proper understanding and implementation of the 7 Fires Prophecy;
          iii) Counter misappropriation or misinterpretation of indigenous knowledge and cultural expressions;
          iv) Facilitate the transmission of cultural knowledge to future generations in appropriate and authorized ways.

**11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND JURISDICTION**
   By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with the Work, you (the "User") irrevocably agree that this license constitutes a binding contract between you and the Rights Holder. As a fundamental, non-negotiable condition of this contract, you expressly agree to the following forum selection and choice of law provisions, and you waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by the forums listed herein. Any attempt to initiate legal proceedings in a forum other than those specified, or any challenge to the jurisdiction of the designated tribal forums, shall be considered a material breach of this license, resulting in immediate revocation of all rights granted hereunder and subjecting the User to all enforcement actions and remedies outlined herein, including the liquidated damages specified in Section 11.8.

   The terms, interpretation, and enforcement of this license incorporate and are informed by tribal sovereignty principles, federal Indian law, traditional Indigenous law of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and international Indigenous rights frameworks.

   **11.1 Governing Law Hierarchy:** Disputes shall be resolved according to the following hierarchy of applicable law:
      a) The express terms of this license;
      b) The laws, customs, and traditions of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
      c) Federal Indian law, including but not limited to relevant treaties, statutes, regulations, and case law;
      d) International instruments concerning Indigenous rights, such as UNDRIP and the WIPO Treaty on Traditional Knowledge;
      e) General principles of intellectual property law, modified as necessary to account for the unique nature of Indigenous intellectual property, TK, and TCEs, with any conflicts resolved in favor of Indigenous rights under the Indian canons of construction.

   **11.2 Primary Jurisdiction Hierarchy:** The following jurisdictional hierarchy shall apply to any and all disputes arising under or related to this license:
      a) BEAVER ISLAND BAND PRIORITY: If and when the Beaver Island Band establishes its own tribal court or equivalent legal forum, such forum shall have primary and first jurisdiction over all disputes.
      b) GTBOCI JURISDICTION: If the Beaver Island Band forum does not exist or is unavailable, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court shall have primary and exclusive jurisdiction.

   **11.3 Special Jurisdiction for Authorized Monitoring:** Notwithstanding the general hierarchy, any dispute arising directly from the Authorized Sacred Site Monitoring activities (Section 8(g)) shall be subject to the following specific jurisdiction:
      a) For the Garden Island burial grounds (LTBB trust land), jurisdiction shall lie with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) Tribal Court.
      b) For the Beaver Island Stone Circle (GTBOCI trust land), jurisdiction shall lie with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court.

   **11.4 Jurisdictional Principles:**
      a) **Tribal Court Exhaustion:** All parties must first fully exhaust available tribal court remedies before seeking relief in any other forum. This exhaustion requirement is a mandatory prerequisite to any action in another court and is based on the well-established principles of comity and deference to tribal self-government articulated in foundational federal Indian law cases such as *National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe of Indians*, 471 U.S. 845 (1985). Challenges to tribal court jurisdiction must be raised exclusively within that tribal court in the first instance.
      b) **Sovereign Immunity:** Nothing in this License shall be construed as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of any tribal nation.
      c) **Indian Canons of Construction:** All ambiguities in this license shall be interpreted liberally in favor of tribal interests, sovereignty, and the Rights Holder's intent.
      d) **Choice of Forum:** The Rights Holder retains absolute discretion to select the most appropriate forum within the established hierarchy.
      e) **Cross-Jurisdictional Enforcement:** Judgments obtained in tribal courts shall be enforceable in federal and state courts under principles of comity and full faith and credit.

   **11.5 Alternative Dispute Resolution:** The parties may, upon mutual written agreement, submit disputes to alternative resolution mechanisms (e.g., mediation, arbitration) that respect Indigenous protocols and tribal sovereignty.

   **11.6 Enforcement Costs:** Any party found to be in breach of this license shall be liable for all reasonable costs incurred by the Rights Holder (or their successor) in enforcing the license, including attorneys' fees, court costs, investigation expenses, and expert witness fees. This provision for cost recovery shall not be limited by Section 14 (Limitation of Liability).

   **11.7 Remedies Allocation:** All **Total Proceeds** (as defined in Section 1(i)) resulting from any dispute resolution process shall be allocated as specified in Section 9A.8 (during the Rights Holder's lifetime) or Section 10.3 (posthumously to the Legacy Beneficiary).

   **11.8 Liquidated Damages for Jurisdictional Breach:** As a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that would be suffered, you agree that any action you initiate that challenges the jurisdictional provisions of this Section 11, or that is filed in a forum other than those designated herein, constitutes a material breach of this license. You acknowledge that such a breach will cause significant harm to the Rights Holder, including substantial costs for legal representation, diversion of resources from the core mission of the Trust, and potential damage to the integrity of the Indigenous sovereignty framework established herein, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain. Upon such breach, you shall be immediately liable to the Rights Holder or their successor for liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($100,000 USD), which you agree is a reasonable and genuine pre-estimate of the damages and not a penalty. This amount is in addition to any other remedies available under this license, including enforcement costs (Section 11.6) and immediate injunctive relief, and serves as a financial disincentive to breach the agreed-upon jurisdictional terms and to cover the initial costs of defending the proper forum.

**12. AUDIT RIGHTS**
    The Rights Holder, or their designated successor authority or the Trust established under Section 10.3 (hereafter 'Auditing Party'), shall have the right, upon providing reasonable written notice (no less than 10 business days), to audit and inspect the records, systems, facilities, and practices of any individual, entity, corporation, institution, or other party granted any form of access to or use of the Work under this license (hereafter 'Audited Party'). The purpose of such audits shall be to verify compliance with all terms and conditions of this license, including but not limited to: usage restrictions (Section 7, Section 8), adherence to Prior Informed Consent requirements (Section 9), compliance with TK Label protocols (Section 4), data governance obligations, attribution requirements (Section 3), and prohibitions on unauthorized modifications or distributions. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Audited Party\'s operations. The Audited Party shall provide reasonable cooperation and access to necessary personnel, records, and systems. If an audit reveals a material breach of this license, the Audited Party shall bear the full costs associated with the audit, in addition to any other remedies pursued by the Auditing Party. Confidential information of the Audited Party obtained during an audit shall be treated with appropriate confidentiality by the Auditing Party, subject to disclosure obligations required for license enforcement or under applicable law.

    Audits may include digital forensics per Section 9A.7. Breaching parties bear all costs, including minimum $10,000 liquidated damages per violation, to enable wealth reclamation for communities.

**13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**
    THE WORK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING TRIBAL LAW AND FEDERAL INDIAN LAW AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 11), THE RIGHTS HOLDER PROVIDES THE WORK AS-IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.

**14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING TRIBAL LAW AND FEDERAL INDIAN LAW AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 11), IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (SUCH AS DELIBERATE AND GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ACTS) OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL THE RIGHTS HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

**15. SEVERABILITY AND PERPETUITY**
    This license is intended to be perpetual and apply to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. If any provision of this license is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction by a competent forum (giving due deference to the chosen tribal forum), such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this license or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. The provision in question shall be reformed, construed, and enforced in such jurisdiction to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, in a manner that most closely achieves the original purpose and intent of this license, particularly the protection of Indigenous rights, sovereignty, and wealth reclamation principles. This license shall be interpreted holistically to uphold these core principles.

    If any provision conflicts with public policy, it shall be reformed to align with indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., UNDRIP) while preserving intent, per sui generis best practices.

**15.A ENHANCED SEVERABILITY FOR INCARCERATION SCENARIOS**
    In recognition of potential legal challenges during periods of incarceration or arbitrary detention, the following enhanced severability protections apply:
    
    a) **CORE PROVISION PROTECTION**: The following provisions are deemed fundamental and non-severable, meaning that if challenged, alternative enforcement mechanisms must be implemented rather than striking the provisions entirely:
       (i) Force majeure protections for incarceration scenarios (Section 13.6-13.9)
       (ii) Successor authority provisions during detention (Section 10.2A)
       (iii) Inalienability protections against forced alienation (Section 6.3(g)-(h))
       (iv) Tribal jurisdiction supremacy during incarceration (Section 12.5)
       (v) Automatic payment systems to Legacy Beneficiary during detention
    
    b) **ALTERNATIVE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**: If any court finds core incarceration protections unenforceable in their primary form, the following alternatives automatically activate:
       (i) DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL ENFORCEMENT: Government-to-government diplomatic intervention through federal trust responsibility
       (ii) INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION: Binding arbitration under UNCITRAL rules with Indigenous law specialists
       (iii) TREATY RIGHT ENFORCEMENT: Direct enforcement through federal Indian law and treaty protections
       (iv) TRIBAL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY: Enhanced sovereign immunity protections for license assets and operations
    
    c) **JURISDICTIONAL FLEXIBILITY**: If tribal court jurisdiction is challenged in the context of incarceration:
       (i) Federal courts with demonstrated expertise in federal Indian law become primary forum
       (ii) International arbitration under Indigenous rights frameworks becomes available
       (iii) Diplomatic intervention through UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Rights may be invoked
       (iv) Human rights monitoring organizations may be engaged for oversight
    
    d) **CONSTITUTIONAL BACKUP PROTECTIONS**: All incarceration protections are supported by multiple constitutional and international law foundations:
       (i) Article VI Supremacy Clause protecting federal Indian law
       (ii) Treaty rights under government-to-government relationship
       (iii) Due process protections under 5th and 14th Amendments
       (iv) UNDRIP protections for Indigenous intellectual property rights
       (v) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protections
    
    e) **ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION SAFEGUARDS**: Courts cannot circumvent incarceration protections by:
       (i) Claiming public policy exceptions to tribal sovereignty
       (ii) Applying general criminal law to override specific Indigenous rights protections
       (iii) Using state law to defeat federal Indian law supremacy
       (iv) Ignoring government-to-government diplomatic immunity principles

**16. NOTIFICATION AND COMMUNICATION**
    All formal notifications, requests for Prior Informed Consent (PIC), reports, or other communications required or permitted under this license shall be delivered in writing to the Rights Holder\'s designated contact information provided below, or, where appropriate and specified, to the officially designated offices of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

    This document constitutes the entire agreement between the user of the Work and the Rights Holder concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written. No amendment or modification of this License shall be effective unless explicitly stated as an updated version of this license by the Rights Holder. No waiver of any provision of this license shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Rights Holder.

**18. SUPPORT FOR COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTIONS**
    Users of the Work acknowledge the paramount importance of protecting Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes, including the stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik\'Waakanda) (land held in trust by GTBOCI). While this license establishes specific controls related to the licensed Work, users agree, as a matter of principle and respect for Indigenous sovereignty and cultural heritage, not to undertake actions governed by this license that would knowingly undermine or obstruct separate efforts by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to secure additional legal or physical protections for such sites (e.g., through conservation easements, land designations, physical access controls, or other mechanisms). This section also explicitly protects the Rights Holder's works as an educator, artist, engineer, and consultant, including classes, content, designs, and consultations, by deeming any unauthorized use thereof a breach subject to all remedies herein.

**19. HEADINGS AND CAPTIONS**
   The headings, captions, and index included in this license are for convenience and reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of this license.

**20. BEAVER ISLAND BAND ADVANCEMENT CLAUSE**
   All provisions of this license, including but not limited to Total Proceeds allocation (Section 1(i)), Legacy Trust purposes (Section 10.3.d), and educational priorities (Sections 10.4-10.6), shall be interpreted to prioritize and support the revival, recognition, and self-determination of the Beaver Island Band as a distinct Anishinaabe entity. This clause is non-severable and supersedes any conflicting interpretation.

   a) **Tribal Court Exhaustion:**
      i) All parties must first exhaust available tribal court remedies before seeking relief in any other forum
      ii) This requirement applies regardless of the basis for the claim or the citizenship status of the parties
      iii) Tribal court decisions are entitled to full faith and credit or comity in other jurisdictions

   b) **Choice of Forum:**
      i) The Rights Holder retains absolute discretion to select the most appropriate forum within the established hierarchy
      ii) Selection of a particular forum does not waive the right to later invoke jurisdiction of another appropriate forum
      iii) Forum selection must prioritize protection of tribal sovereignty and Indigenous rights

   c) **Cross-Jurisdictional Enforcement:**
      i) Judgments obtained in tribal courts shall be enforceable in federal and state courts
      ii) Enforcement actions must respect tribal sovereignty and self-determination
      iii) State courts must apply principles of comity to tribal court decisions

   11.4. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as:
   a) Waiving the sovereign immunity of any tribal nation
   b) Consenting to jurisdiction beyond what is explicitly granted
   c) Diminishing tribal sovereign rights or authorities

The Rights Holder encourages registration of copyrightable elements with the U.S. Copyright Office or equivalents. Sui generis rights supplement, but do not replace, standard IP protections (e.g., moral rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106A). In jurisdictions without TK recognition, enforce via contract law.

Users may optionally apply CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 to derivatives, provided it subordinates to this license's TK Labels, PIC, and CARE Principles. Include: 'This derivative is CC-BY-NC-SA but subject to [link to this license].' Ensure CC use respects collective ownership per Wikipedia on indigenous IP.

11.9 Challenges to tribal jurisdiction must first be raised in the primary tribal forum (11.1). Exhaustion of tribal remedies is required per federal Indian law precedents, with ambiguities resolved in favor of sovereignty (Indian canons).

Users may subscribe for update notifications at [email/contact]. Lack of subscription does not excuse non-compliance; updates align with evolving WIPO standards.
